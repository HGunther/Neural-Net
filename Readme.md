# Neural Network
This program was written to gain experience with neural networks.

## Dependencies

This network was written in Python 3 using the numpy and scipy libraries.

## Features

* Arbitrary number of layers
* Arbitrary number of nodes per layer
* Activation functions can be swapped
* Learning through gradient decent

## How to use

Two examples of how to use the program are included in this repository. The two class example uses data generated from two different distributions and attempts to learn and distinguish data between the two classes. The ten class example uses data from the MNIST digit image set. This dataset is included in TensorFlow.
